	/**
	 * When testing a web page, sometimes unexpected overlays like a "Sign up" dialog appear and block actions you want to
	 * automate, e.g. clicking a button. These overlays don't always show up in the same way or at the same time, making
	 * them tricky to handle in automated tests.
	 *
	 * This method lets you set up a special function, called a handler, that activates when it detects that overlay is
	 * visible. The handler's job is to remove the overlay, allowing your test to continue as if the overlay wasn't there.
	 *
	 * Things to keep in mind:
	 * - When an overlay is shown predictably, we recommend explicitly waiting for it in your test and dismissing it as
	 *   a part of your normal test flow, instead of using
	 *   [page.addLocatorHandler(locator, handler[, options])](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-add-locator-handler).
	 * - Playwright checks for the overlay every time before executing or retrying an action that requires an
	 *   [actionability check](https://playwright.dev/docs/actionability), or before performing an auto-waiting assertion check. When overlay
	 *   is visible, Playwright calls the handler first, and then proceeds with the action/assertion. Note that the
	 *   handler is only called when you perform an action/assertion - if the overlay becomes visible but you don't
	 *   perform any actions, the handler will not be triggered.
	 * - After executing the handler, Playwright will ensure that overlay that triggered the handler is not visible
	 *   anymore. You can opt-out of this behavior with
	 *   [`noWaitAfter`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-add-locator-handler-option-no-wait-after).
	 * - The execution time of the handler counts towards the timeout of the action/assertion that executed the handler.
	 *   If your handler takes too long, it might cause timeouts.
	 * - You can register multiple handlers. However, only a single handler will be running at a time. Make sure the
	 *   actions within a handler don't depend on another handler.
	 *
	 * **NOTE** Running the handler will alter your page state mid-test. For example it will change the currently focused
	 * element and move the mouse. Make sure that actions that run after the handler are self-contained and do not rely on
	 * the focus and mouse state being unchanged.
	 *
	 * For example, consider a test that calls
	 * [locator.focus([options])](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-focus) followed by
	 * [keyboard.press(key[, options])](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-keyboard#keyboard-press). If your handler
	 * clicks a button between these two actions, the focused element most likely will be wrong, and key press will happen
	 * on the unexpected element. Use
	 * [locator.press(key[, options])](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-press) instead to avoid this
	 * problem.
	 *
	 * Another example is a series of mouse actions, where
	 * [mouse.move(x, y[, options])](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-mouse#mouse-move) is followed by
	 * [mouse.down([options])](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-mouse#mouse-down). Again, when the handler runs
	 * between these two actions, the mouse position will be wrong during the mouse down. Prefer self-contained actions
	 * like [locator.click([options])](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator#locator-click) that do not rely on
	 * the state being unchanged by a handler.
	 *
	 * **Usage**
	 *
	 * An example that closes a "Sign up to the newsletter" dialog when it appears:
	 *
	 * ```js
	 * // Setup the handler.
	 * await page.addLocatorHandler(page.getByText('Sign up to the newsletter'), async () => {
	 *   await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'No thanks' }).click();
	 * });
	 *
	 * // Write the test as usual.
	 * await page.goto('https://example.com');
	 * await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Start here' }).click();
	 * ```
	 *
	 * An example that skips the "Confirm your security details" page when it is shown:
	 *
	 * ```js
	 * // Setup the handler.
	 * await page.addLocatorHandler(page.getByText('Confirm your security details'), async () => {
	 *   await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Remind me later' }).click();
	 * });
	 *
	 * // Write the test as usual.
	 * await page.goto('https://example.com');
	 * await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Start here' }).click();
	 * ```
	 *
	 * An example with a custom callback on every actionability check. It uses a `<body>` locator that is always visible,
	 * so the handler is called before every actionability check. It is important to specify
	 * [`noWaitAfter`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-add-locator-handler-option-no-wait-after), because
	 * the handler does not hide the `<body>` element.
	 *
	 * ```js
	 * // Setup the handler.
	 * await page.addLocatorHandler(page.locator('body'), async () => {
	 *   await page.evaluate(() => window.removeObstructionsForTestIfNeeded());
	 * }, { noWaitAfter: true });
	 *
	 * // Write the test as usual.
	 * await page.goto('https://example.com');
	 * await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Start here' }).click();
	 * ```
	 *
	 * Handler takes the original locator as an argument. You can also automatically remove the handler after a number of
	 * invocations by setting [`times`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-add-locator-handler-option-times):
	 *
	 * ```js
	 * await page.addLocatorHandler(page.getByLabel('Close'), async locator => {
	 *   await locator.click();
	 * }, { times: 1 });
	 * ```
	 *
	 * @param locator Locator that triggers the handler.
	 * @param handler Function that should be run once
	 * [`locator`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-add-locator-handler-option-locator) appears. This
